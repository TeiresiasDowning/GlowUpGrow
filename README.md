# GlowUpGrow
Welcome! 
This is the repository for the open-source project to put the power of producing food for survival and thriving back into the hands of everyday people.
Agriculture enabled human society by allowing some people to not need to be working on food-finding all the time.
The goal of this project is to use technology to push toward a post-scarcity future, wherein food is not something that is at risk in times of economic or societal distress.

The first step is to work on setting up cost-efficient, simple automated systems to take care of plants, since people don't have the time to grow the plants themselves. 
This is where we're working on that.
